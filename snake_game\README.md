Snake Game in Python using Pygame
================================

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame.

To run the game, simply execute `python main.py` in your terminal.

Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to control the snake. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without hitting the wall or yourself.

Have fun!
